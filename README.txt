Description:     This IT management system exists to provide small business managers and IT technicians to
		 have full scope over their assets, employees, and issues that might be impeding them from
		 delivering their products and services. It also gives employees the ability to access some
		 information from a web client, and gives them the ability to submit tickets about faulty
		 equipment.

Components:	 This system is separated into two components: The Desktop Application used by high
		 permission level internal parties in order to access and modify relevant information for
		 the business, and the Web Application will provide other employees with the ability to
		 submit tickets regarding maintenance and view relevant information.
		
		 The Desktop Application includes:
			- A Login Section that limits access to users with sufficient permissions
			- A Main Menu that provides general information about the software and gives users
			  the ability to navigate between different tabs
			- An Equipment Screen that gives users detailed information about company equipment
			- An Employee Screen that gives users detailed information about employees
			- A Ticket Screen that gives users detailed information about tickets submitted by
			   employees

		 The Web Application Includes:
			- A Login section that limits access to users that are employees
			- A Main Menu that provides general information about the web application and gives
			  users the ability to navigate between different tabs
			- A Ticket Screen that gives employees the ability to submit tickets about issues
			- An Equipment tab that gives employees the ability to check out equipment
